<p>My aim here is not simply to provide a few recommendations to read, but rather to compile a thorough, annotated bibliography of literature on dueling. It is a work in progress, both as it takes time to build, and I&#39;m always discovering more to read anyways. As such, this includes books which might be very, very dry, very esoteric, or just plain boring. Obviously though, I also want this to be useful to the casually interested layman, so have noted books which I consider to be particularly worth reading with <img src="//b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/fFIa6je-JrcUxU7gkMQ48CLaIb5CfT99WJyhmUokbHA.png" alt="" />. Links are provided where possible, but may be behind paywalls in many cases. Also, of course, be pre-warned for PDFs.</p>
<p>My goal, for all intents and purposes, is to assemble - and read - a fairly complete bibliography of English language works written on the duel of honor since 1896, and while the <em>true</em> accomplishment of that is likely far off, if not out of reach, the below is, as far as I’m aware, the most extensive compilation to that effect. Beyond this are included various works which are not treatises on the duel, or its immediate socio-cultural sphere, but are nevertheless of interest in closely adjacent topics, such as the idea of “Honor”, “Civility”, or “Public Opinion”, or focused on the larger picture of the gentleman of the period. These works are not placed into their own categories, but nevertheless ought to be considered adjacent to the core of the bibliography assembled here, as to include them and works of their ilk in the end goal would most certainly inflate the size several times over. But the duel ought not be studied in a vacuum, and an understanding of its place in the culture. And finally, I have only included works that are part of <em>my</em> collection, as my intent is to compile exactly that, a <em>collection</em> of these works, and not simply a list of extant sources. At this point, I am truly navigating the fringes for obscure publications, but there is always more out there, some quite hard to find.</p>
<p>As a side note, 1896 is not chosen by accident, being the year of Thimm’s classic “<em>A Complete Bibliography of Fencing &amp; Duelling”</em>, which provides an exhaustive level of resources to look for for anyone interested in 19th century and earlier works, both primary and secondary. A few pre-1896 works are included, but simply because they are interesting, not because I am attempting to be thorough. Nevertheless, a by no means complete - nor ever intended to be so - selection of interesting primary and ‘classic’ sources are also added here, including early secondary sources, memoirs, dueling manuals, and court transcripts. For the most part, these are all sources which are digitized and can be found online, or in reasonable priced reprints, and the intention in including them is to provide some flavorful reading from the time when dueling was not such a distant memory, although many can also be quite suspect in their details, and none are a substitute for well researched modern literature if seeking to better understand the duel.</p>

<li>Baldick, Robert. <a href="https://amzn.to/2PBQmmh" rel="nofollow"><em>The Duel: A History</em></a>. Chapman &amp; Hall, 1965: Written in the 60s, this book is a bit lacking in depth, unfortunately, but it nevertheless is a fun and entertaining read. What it lacks in analysis it makes up for with a cornucopia of anecdotes illustrating the colorful history of the duel through the ages. </li>
<li>Banks, Stephen. <a href="https://amzn.to/2Nuk6Dr" rel="nofollow"><em>Duels and Duelling</em></a>. Shire Publications, 2012. A very short cursory introduction, but from a pretty accomplished historian of the duel.</li>

Random House, 2007: More properly, a history of (mostly Western) swordsmanship, dueling of course is a key focus of the book, even if much of the latter portion deals with sport fencing. It should also be noted that Cohen is not an historian himself, although he does a very decent job writing solid pop history.</li>

<li>Holland, Barbara <a href="https://amzn.to/2BLyZfM" rel="nofollow"><em>Gentlemen&#39;s Blood: A History of Dueling from Swords at Dawn to Pistols at Dusk</em></a>. Bloomsbury, 2008: Holland has a wonderfully sarcastic style, which is definitely one of the high points of the book, and which improves on Baldick by offering a more cohesive approach to the subject, but similarly relies heavily on anecdotes to drive the narrative. Still, all in all, the book provides a decent overview of dueling history, and a very snarky one at that.</li>
<li><img src="//b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/fFIa6je-JrcUxU7gkMQ48CLaIb5CfT99WJyhmUokbHA.png" alt="" /> Hopton, Richard. <a href="https://amzn.to/2waTkpU" rel="nofollow"><em>Pistols at Dawn: A History of Duelling</em></a>. Little, Brown, 2011: If you are looking for a decently written and researched pop history introduction, this is the book for you! Providing a general overview of the history of the duel in Europe, while it has its small errors and simplifications, all in all, it provides a solid survey for someone who doesn&#39;t want to jump into more academic works yet. </li>
<li>Kiernan, V.G. <a href="https://amzn.to/2o8sydd" rel="nofollow"><em>The Duel in European History: Honour and the Reign of Aristocracy</em></a>. Oxford University Press, 1988: Certainly the most academic of introductory tests, Kiernan provides a well written, well sourced overview of the history and development of the duel of honor.  The book is not without criticism, especially of Kiernan’s Marxist perspective on the class-nature of the duel which is hard not to miss and at times detracting, but despite starting to show its age, it remains one of the core works for any study of dueling history.</li>
<li>Leigh, John. <a href="https://amzn.to/2obOrbm" rel="nofollow"><em>Touché: The Duel in Literature</em></a>. Harvard University Press, 2015: An interesting look at the duel not so much as it was practiced but as it was seen, approaching it was a literary device, and how its meaning changed through time and location.</li>

<li>Sedgwick, John &quot;<a href="https://amzn.to/2N2Xc27" rel="nofollow">War of Two: Alexander Hamilton, Aaron Burr, and the Duel that Stunned the Nation</a>&quot;: Frankly, quite an underwhelming book.

While I can say this was somewhat useful in fleshing out a biographical sketch of Burr for me, it is essentially Chernow-lite for Hamilton, and offers a complete lack of insight or analysis of the duel itself, which feels almost rushed over, compared to other works I have read on the topic.</li>

<p>The classic image of the ‘shootout’ is not a duel in the sense of the classic ‘duel off honor’, but does exist on a continuum that includes both. It is, for the most part, outside of my general purview, but nevertheless being related, a few works which touch on the topic are included here, although to be sure, they speak more to how the idea of the meeting at high-noon is more fiction than fact.</p>
